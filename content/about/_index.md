## About this blog

This is the official blog for the [k0s project](https//k0sproject.io).

Here we will share new, technical deep-dives, and practical guides around:

- [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/) - the simple, solid and certified [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) distribution
- [k0smotron](https://k0smotron.io/) - the Kubernetes control plane manager

Our goal is to make Kubernetes more approachable while showing what makes k0s and k0smostron unique.
Thanks for stopping by!
